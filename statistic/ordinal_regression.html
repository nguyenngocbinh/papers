<li><strong>Khái niệm:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mô hình hồi quy logistic thứ tự là gì?</strong>: Hồi quy logistic thứ tự là một phương pháp phân tích thống kê được sử dụng khi <strong>biến phụ thuộc</strong> có thứ tự, nghĩa là các giá trị của biến phụ thuộc có một thứ tự tự nhiên <em>nhưng không nhất thiết có khoảng cách đều nhau giữa các giá trị</em>. Ví dụ về biến phụ thuộc có thứ tự bao gồm mức độ hài lòng của khách hàng (rất không hài lòng, không hài lòng, trung lập, hài lòng, rất hài lòng) hoặc trình độ học vấn (tiểu học, trung học, đại học).</li>
<li><strong>Ví dụ:</strong> Giả sử chúng ta muốn nghiên cứu các yếu tố ảnh hưởng đến mức độ hài lòng của khách hàng sử dụng dịch vụ của một công ty. Biến phụ thuộc là mức độ hài lòng của khách hàng với 5 mức độ: “Rất không hài lòng”, “Không hài lòng”, “Trung lập”, “Hài lòng”, “Rất hài lòng”.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tóm-lại">Tóm lại</h3>
<p>Trong mô hình Ordinal Logit, xác suất cho mỗi mức độ hài lòng được tính toán dựa trên thứ tự của các mức độ đó. Mỗi xác suất được tính bằng cách sử dụng các điểm cắt và các hệ số hồi quy ước lượng. Điều này giúp mô hình sử dụng thông tin thứ tự của các mức độ để đưa ra các dự đoán chính xác hơn so với mô hình không thứ tự như Multinomial Logit.</p>

<p>QWK sẽ phản ánh mức độ đồng thuận kém hơn giữa dự báo và thực tế.</p>
<p>QWK là một chỉ số quan trọng trong việc đánh giá mô hình dự báo trong các bài toán phân loại thứ bậc, đặc biệt khi các hạng mục có thứ tự. Nó giúp chúng ta hiểu rõ hơn về mức độ tương đồng giữa dự báo của mô hình và giá trị thực tế, qua đó cải thiện chất lượng mô hình.</p>
