    "   - **Khái niệm:** \n",
    "     - **Mô hình hồi quy logistic thứ tự là gì?**: Hồi quy logistic thứ tự là một phương pháp phân tích thống kê được sử dụng khi **biến phụ thuộc** có thứ tự, nghĩa là các giá trị của biến phụ thuộc có một thứ tự tự nhiên *nhưng không nhất thiết có khoảng cách đều nhau giữa các giá trị*. Ví dụ về biến phụ thuộc có thứ tự bao gồm mức độ hài lòng của khách hàng (rất không hài lòng, không hài lòng, trung lập, hài lòng, rất hài lòng) hoặc trình độ học vấn (tiểu học, trung học, đại học).\n",
    "     - **Ví dụ:** Giả sử chúng ta muốn nghiên cứu các yếu tố ảnh hưởng đến mức độ hài lòng của khách hàng sử dụng dịch vụ của một công ty. Biến phụ thuộc là mức độ hài lòng của khách hàng với 5 mức độ: \"Rất không hài lòng\", \"Không hài lòng\", \"Trung lập\", \"Hài lòng\", \"Rất hài lòng\".\n",
